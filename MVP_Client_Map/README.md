# PGIS PROJECT (Client_Map_FrontEnd) 

![IT4PROS LOGO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86312558/177416312-89e38d23-2b34-43f8-abc2-77a5ede346d2.png)

## Background.

This project is integrated into the `Holberton School` Full Stack Engineer end-of-course curriculum.

The project is included in the cooperation of companies with Holberton, the company that selected us is `SIS Vida` from Colombia.

The main idea of the project is the creation of a visualization of a series of health services provided by an insurance company. This visualization is within a georeferencing system (map embedded in a web), where the lenders of the area selected by the user's GPS location will appear.

We have separated this project into 3 different fields to make it easier for the end user or client to develop and understand. These parts are:

* Back End: 
  * Where the main API for use is developed 

  * The database has been created.

  * Where the relationships and interactions between the different modules that make up the project are developed.

* Front End Client Side:
  
  * Where the georeferencing map appears on the screen to show the points of interest of the project.

  * Where the client (user) interacts with the map.

* Front End Administrator side:

  * Where the administration dashboard appears on the screen.

  * Where the administrator of project can change the registries and data completes the project.

## Front End client side

In this repository we are going to document the development of the georeferencing module, describing the used codebase and the different applications, libraries and interactions that we have used.

To carry out this documentation, we are going to develop the used work process, the available resources and examples and images to illustrate the path we have followed.

## Used work process

We have created a framework based on agile technology that we will demonstrate below:

* `Plan`: 
  
  * Develop the business idea or project idea.

  * Develop the technology to be used
  
  * Collect software resources
  
  * Develop time management systems.

* `Design`:

  * Divide the process into modules for better understanding

  * Create different modules of software (recursive actions)

* `Development`:
  
  * Build the codebase.

  * Build the screenshots and MVP.

  * Build the containers and servers to deploy the project.

* `Test`:

  * Build the tests to run in different environments (app, web, servers, browsers...)

  * Improve the tests for MVP.

* `Deploy`:

  * Present the version to customers or public.

  * Accept the changes or different oppinions.

* `Review and go to next development or requirement of the project.`

## Resources:

We used different frameworks and libraries wich we will explain below:

  * HTML CSS and JavaScript Framework:
    
    * HTML to build the web app to show.

    * CSS to apply styles to an HTML page.

    * JavaScript to add interactions and dependences to the HTML page.

  * Leaflet library and dependences to build and interact with the georeferencing and mapping modules and show the result in the screen.

  * See more documentation at [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/)

  * We used VSC( Visual studio Code) IDE to build the codebase.
