This project is integrated into the Holberton School Full Stack Engineer end-of-course curriculum.

The project is included in the cooperation of companies with Holberton, the company that selected us is SIS Vida from Colombia.

The main idea of the project is the creation of a visualization of a series of health services provided by an insurance company. This visualization is within a georeferencing system (map embedded in a web), where the lenders of the area selected by the user's GPS location will appear.
